# ThreeDriverComparison
A Python tool that loads F1 race data with FastF1 and creates a visual laptime comparison table for three drivers over a selected lap range. It shows each lap time, deltas to a reference driver, and average differences, with customizable team colors and chart settings for quick race-pace analysis.
